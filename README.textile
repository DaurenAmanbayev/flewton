h1. Flewton

Flewton is an extensible Netflow collector.

h2. Configuration

Refer to the comments in the sample configuration shipped with Flewton.

h2. Running

In a nutshell:

bc. 
java [options] -jar flewton.jar

By default, Flewton will search for its configuration file as @/etc/flewton/flewton.cfg@, @/etc/flewton.cfg@, and @./flewton.cfg@, using the first one found.  You can specify a path to your configuration using the @flewton.config@ system property, for example:

bc. 
java -Dflewton.config=/usr/local/etc/flewton.cfg -jar flewton.jar

Flewton uses "log4j":http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2 for logging.  By default, the log level is @INFO@ and output is sent to stdout. To customize logging, create your own log4j.properties and set the @log4j.configuration@ system property:

bc. 
java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:///path/to/log4.props -jar flewton.jar

h2. Known Issues

* Currently only Netflow v5 is supported, but additional Netflow formats are possible by implementing decoder classes as @com.rackspace.flewton.RecordvN@ (where @N@ is the version). See @com.rackspace.flewton.Recordv5@ for an example. Patches welcome.
